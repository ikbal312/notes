/*
Tuples
Tuples are a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of different types in a single variable.
Tuples are not available as a built-in data type in Go. However, you can create a tuple-like data structure using a struct.

Tuples are immutable data structure.
The only way to modify the values of a tuple is to create a new tuple with the modified values.

usage:

	Database records are a good example of tuples. A database record can have multiple fields of different types.
	For example, a database record for a person can have fields like name, age, and address.
	You can create a struct in Go to represent a database record and use it as a tuple.
