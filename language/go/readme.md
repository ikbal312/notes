Fundamental of go

1. go has many types(float,int,slice,map,function,interface,etc)
2. go has three scope(package,function,statement level)
3. go support variable shadowing
4. In package scope only support Declaration
5. slice is grow able array
6. (&variable_name) return memory address of variable
7. function arguments are copies
8. * called OVERLOADED OPERATOR from pointer perspective
9. if * used before pointer variable then its means DEREFERENCE
10. when used between two number then * means multiplication
11. go treats Error as data type
12. In most circumstances, a user should return an error and not panic.
13. As a general rule, only use panic in the main package.
14. When doing concurrent programming, there is a simple rule: You can read a variable
concurrently without synchronization, but a single writer requires synchronization.

15. Reading and writing to the same variable concurrently is called a data race.
